Thanks for checking out my portfolio, my name is Ian Canupp and I'm a software engineer located in Cincinnati, Ohio. I graduated in May of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science from Centre College and since then, have put a whole year of professional experience under my belt at a company called Flooid. Throughout my education and early career, I find that back end technologies such as Java, SQL and MongoDB have been a large focus, and therefore a large strength of mine. However, quarantine has given me ample time to jump head first into many different projects, the latest of which is actually this very website. I'm constantly trying to learn new things, which right now include Golang and more React, something I'll talk in more depth about in the Developer Skills tab."),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"home-par"},"Outside of computer science I'm a huge basketball fan, specifically the New York Knicks. I know that anyone who watches even a little NBA is probably questioning my sanity and decision making, but don't worry because so am I. A passion for the sport has opened the way for me to discover the fascinating world of analytics that lies beneath. It is my goal in the near future to combine my accumulated understanding of these analytics with my front end development knowledge to create a kind of player comparison app, so I might be able to tell you -- with the data in front of me -- exactly how and why the Knicks haven't been near playoffs in over a decade. In fact, sports data analytics would be something of a dream job, but for now I'm happy to figure it out in my apartment."),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"home-par"},"To cap off the at-a-glance version of myself, I did my study abroad in the 'Heart of Europe,' Strasbourg, France. At risk of sounding like every other student who spend any time outside the US, I had an amazing abroad experience and continue to make efforts to maintain and build on the French I studied in school."),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"home-par"},"With that cursory introduction, I hope you have a better idea of who I am than a simple resume could tell you. Of course, if you have questions about anything I've said here or anything I'll say in the next tab over, I would be more than happy for you to reach out and I can clarify anything I might have left overly vague. Again, thank you for taking the time to navigate to this site to learn more about me, it is greatly appreciated and I hope to hear from you soon."),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"sign"},"- Ian Canupp"))}),y=t(3),v=function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"java-about",id:"java"},o.a.createElement("h2",{className:"title"},"Java",o.a.createElement(y.Link,{className:"to-top",activeClass:"active",to:"contents",spy:!0,smooth:!0,offset:-70,duration:500},o.a.createElement("p",{className:"return-text"},o.a.createElement("i",{className:"arrow up"})))),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"content"},"I've been working with Java since Computer Science 101 my freshman year of college, although more recently I've had the ongoing opportunity to apply my skills as a software engineer at Flooid.
