className=\"home-par\">\r\n        Hey! Thanks for checking out my portfolio, my name is Ian Canupp and I'm\r\n        a software engineer located in Cincinnati, Ohio. I graduated in May of\r\n        2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science from Centre College and since then,\r\n        have put a whole year of professional experience under my belt at a\r\n        company called Flooid. Throughout my education and early career, I find\r\n        that back end technologies such as Java, SQL and MongoDB have been a\r\n        large focus, and therefore a large strength of mine. However, quarantine\r\n        has given me ample time to jump head first into many different projects,\r\n        the latest of which is actually this very website. I'm constantly trying\r\n        to learn new things, which right now include Golang and more React,\r\n        something I'll talk in more depth about in the Developer Skills tab.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"home-par\">\r\n        Outside of computer science I'm a huge basketball fan, specifically the\r\n        New York Knicks. I know that anyone who watches even a little NBA is\r\n        probably questioning my sanity and decision making, but don't worry\r\n        because so am I. A passion for the sport has opened the way for me to\r\n        discover the fascinating world of analytics that lies beneath. It is my\r\n        goal in the near future to combine my accumulated understanding of these\r\n        analytics with my front end development knowledge to create a kind of\r\n        player comparison app, so I might be able to tell you -- with the data\r\n        in front of me -- exactly how and why the Knicks haven't been near\r\n        playoffs in over a decade. In fact, sports data analytics would be\r\n        something of a dream job, but for now I'm happy to figure it out in my\r\n        apartment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"home-par\">\r\n        To cap off the at-a-glance version of myself, I did my study abroad in\r\n        the 'Heart of Europe,' Strasbourg, France. At risk of sounding like\r\n        every other student who spend any time outside the US, I had an amazing\r\n        abroad experience and continue to make efforts to maintain and build on\r\n        the French I studied in school.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"home-par\">\r\n        With that cursory introduction, I hope you have a better idea of who I\r\n        am than a simple resume could tell you. Of course, if you have questions\r\n        about anything I've said here or anything I'll say in the next tab over,\r\n        I would be more than happy for you to reach out and I can clarify\r\n        anything I might have left overly vague. Again, thank you for taking the\r\n        time to navigate to this site to learn more about me, it is greatly\r\n        appreciated and I hope to hear from you soon.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"sign\">- Ian Canupp</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Home;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-scroll\";\r\n\r\nconst JavaAbout = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"about\" id=\"java\">\r\n      <h2 className=\"title\">\r\n        <i className=\"fab fa-java\"> Java</i>\r\n        <Link\r\n          className=\"to-top\"\r\n          activeClass=\"active\"\r\n          to=\"contents\"\r\n          spy={true}\r\n          smooth={true}\r\n          offset={-70}\r\n          duration={500}\r\n        >\r\n          <p className=\"return-text\">\r\n            <i className=\"arrow up\"></i>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </Link>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        I've been working with Java since Computer Science 101 my freshman year\r\n        of college, although more recently I've had the ongoing opportunity to\r\n        apply my skills as a software engineer at Flooid. This has allowed me to\r\n        work on brand new software features for their Vision Commerce Suite\r\n        (VCS), a retail commerce system designed specifically for large\r\n        retailers. Development for VCS has included work on retail point of sale\r\n        systems as well as headless self checkout software. Alongside product\r\n        development, I work on a small team to maintain innovative\r\n        implementations for various clients, including Trader Joes and Phillip\r\n        van Heusen.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        Working in a product environment has been illuminating for numerous\r\n        reasons, and one of the most valuable lessons I've learned so far has\r\n        been how to design solutions with scaling in mind. In school, there was\r\n        nothing I ever built that required anything near the level of\r\n        abstraction I've learned to expect in my career. When working with such\r\n        vast, complex and interfacing code, it's as vital to insure you don't\r\n        break anything now as it is to make sure you won't break anything later.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        Another skill I never knew I would lean so heavily on is the ability to\r\n        read code that I hadn't written. As I type this, I realize it isn't a\r\n        revolutionary revelation, nor one specific to Java, but it's one that\r\n        has become absolutely invaluable when debugging or parsing through call\r\n        heirarchies -- two things any good developer should be experienced at.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        <a className=\"tags\">Skills: </a>\r\n        <a>\r\n          Java, Object-oriented Programming, Debugging, Eclipse, IntelliJ,\r\n          Maven, Tortoise, git\r\n        </a>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default JavaAbout;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-scroll\";\r\n\r\nconst SQLAbout = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"about\" id=\"sql\">\r\n      <h2 className=\"title\">\r\n        <div>\r\n          <i className=\"fas fa-database\"></i>\r\n          <a className=\"sql-title\"> Databases</a>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <Link\r\n          className=\"to-top\"\r\n          activeClass=\"active\"\r\n          to=\"contents\"\r\n          spy={true}\r\n          smooth={true}\r\n          offset={-70}\r\n          duration={500}\r\n        >\r\n          <p>\r\n            <i className=\"arrow up\"></i>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </Link>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        Coming in at a close second to Java, SQL is another language in which\r\n        I'm more than proficient. Interestingly enough, before I had taken a\r\n        course or learned what a Relational Database Management System was, my\r\n        summer internship at Willis Towers Watson had me writing queries in C#\r\n        to pull data for an application they planned to build. As fun as that\r\n        was, I've come miles from where I stood that summer in terms of\r\n        understanding and working with RDBMSs. In college the following\r\n        semester, I worked on a team as part of a term-long project to design,\r\n        build and populate a database for a real-world company in Louisville.\r\n        For the project we used a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to\r\n        build an application to present at the final. It was a bit rocky, but I\r\n        learned a lot about connecting a front facing application to a database,\r\n        as well as how to protect against injection attacks (Little Bobby\r\n        Tables, anyone?).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        Flash forward to today, and querying our database is usually part of my\r\n        day-to-day activities here, where we use both SQuirrel and DBeaver\r\n        RDBMSs. Whether I need to look up a certain promotion, find a loyalty\r\n        customer or hunt down a geography code, I'm making sure my SQL skills\r\n        don't get too rusty. On top of that, I've gained experience with the\r\n        document-oriented database program, MongoDB. With it I built a weekly\r\n        report generator for Trader Joes so that managers could select a date\r\n        and see figures such as categorized sales totals, gift card numbers and\r\n        overall profits. The majority of this was, of course, done in Java but\r\n        it served as a great tool in further understanding that pipeline between\r\n        database and application.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        <a className=\"tags\">Skills: </a>\r\n        <a>SQL, MongoDB, SQuirrel SQL Client, DBeaver, Apache</a>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default SQLAbout;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-scroll\";\r\n\r\nconst ReactAbout = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"about\" id=\"react\">\r\n      <h2 className=\"title\">\r\n        <i className=\"fab fa-react\"> React</i>\r\n        <Link\r\n          className=\"to-top\"\r\n          activeClass=\"active\"\r\n          to=\"contents\"\r\n          spy={true}\r\n          smooth={true}\r\n          offset={-70}\r\n          duration={500}\r\n        >\r\n          <p>\r\n            <i className=\"arrow up\"></i>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </Link>\r\n      </h2>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        At the moment there is no better testament to my React abilities than\r\n        this very website. In college classes, I was only taught the basics of\r\n        web development; things like HTML and very rudimentary PHP. Now that I\r\n        had some time on my hands I thought it was about time I extended my\r\n        skill set towards the other end of the stack. I am entirely self taught\r\n        on this front, going from a Hello React page to building projects like\r\n        this in about two weeks. In developing these apps (many which will never\r\n        see the light of day) I've become far more comfortable with CSS and\r\n        numerous react libraries.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        Additionally, I've realized that the principles of web development\r\n        aren't so different from those I was already accustomed to. For example,\r\n        I found myself surpringly within my comfort zone when introduced to\r\n        certain JavaScript syntaxes (arrow functions, mapping, etc) that I had\r\n        struggled with in those afformentioned classes. And although it is not a\r\n        traditional class-based object-oriented language, JavaScript still lends\r\n        itself well to many of the habits I've developed in those more\r\n        'traditional' OOP languages like Java or C++.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p className=\"content\">\r\n        I can confidently say I've had a lot of fun learning the tools of front\r\n        end development so far. As someone who heard a handful of JS horror\r\n        stories from old classmates or online forums, I'm proud of my progress.\r\n        Sure, when my align-content CSS fails to center for the millionth time,\r\n        it's a bit frustrating, but it's all part of the experience right?

It's still in progress, but\r\n        it's been an incredible and fun learning experience for me - combining\r\n        two of my hobbies into one.
