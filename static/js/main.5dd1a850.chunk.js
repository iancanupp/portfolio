Thanks for checking out my portfolio, my name is Ian Canupp and I'm a software engineer located in Cincinnati, Ohio. I graduated in May of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science from Centre College and since then, have put a whole year of professional experience under my belt at a company called Flooid. Throughout my education and early career, I find that back end technologies such as Java, SQL and MongoDB have been a large focus, and therefore a large strength of mine. However, quarantine has given me ample time to jump head first into many different projects, the latest of which is actually this very website.

I know that anyone who watches even a little NBA is probably questioning my sanity and decision making, and of course it should go without saying that I do the same. That said, my passion for the sport has opened the way for me to discover the fascinating world of analytics that lies beneath. It is my goal in the near future to combine my accumulated understanding of these analytics with my front end development knowledge to create a kind of player comparison app, so I might be able to tell you -- with the data in front of me -- exactly how and why the Knicks haven't been near playoffs in over a decade.

As fun as that was, I've come miles from where I stood that summer in terms of understanding and working with RDBMSs. In college the following semester, I worked on a team as part of a term-long project to design, build and populate a database for a real-world company in Louisville. For the project we used a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to build an application to present at the final.

On top of that, I've gained experience with the document-oriented database program, MongoDB. With it I built a weekly report generator for Trader Joes so that managers could select a date and see figures such as categorized sales totals, gift card numbers and overall profits.

For a sudoku, this means backtracking every time you are put in a position where two of the same number occupy the same row, column or box. The largest challenge I faced during this exercise was determining when that crucial rule was broken. When my input came in the form of a 2 dimensional text array, it was difficult at first to figure out how to describe to the program what constituted a 'box.' Fortunately, I was able to overcome this by making a drawing in my notes and tracing the code line by line to see how it should behave.
