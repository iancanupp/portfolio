        Coming in at a close second to Java, SQL is another language in which
        I'm more than proficient. Interestingly enough, before I had taken a
        course or learned what a Relational Database Management System was, my
        summer internship at Willis Towers Watson had me writing queries in C#
        to pull data for an application they planned to build. As fun as that
        was, I've come miles from where I stood that summer in terms of
        understanding and working with RDBMSs. In college the following
        semester, I worked on a team as part of a term-long project to design,
        build and populate a database for a real-world company in Louisville.
        For the project we used a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to
        build an application to present at the final. It was a bit rocky, but I
        learned a lot about connecting a front facing application to a database,
        as well as how to protect against injection attacks (Little Bobby
        Tables, anyone?).

        Flash forward to today, and querying our database is usually part of my
        day-to-day activities here, where we use both SQuirrel and DBeaver
        RDBMSs. Whether I need to look up a certain promotion, find a loyalty
        customer or hunt down a geography code, I'm making sure my SQL skills
        don't get too rusty. On top of that, I've gained experience with the
        document-oriented database program, MongoDB. With it I built a weekly
        report generator for Trader Joes so that managers could select a date
        and see figures such as categorized sales totals, gift card numbers and
        overall profits. The majority of this was, of course, done in Java but
        it served as a great tool in further understanding that pipeline between
        database and application.
